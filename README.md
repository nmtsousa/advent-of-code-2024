# Solving the Advent of Code puzzle in Rust

This project contains my solutions to the Advent of Code using Rust. I the Advent of Code as way to turn all that I have read about Rust into practice and actually learn it by using it.

I wrote my thoughts on this experience on [Medium](https://medium.com/@nuno.mt.sousa/is-the-advent-of-code-a-good-way-to-learn-a-new-programming-language-e7a687332639).

This is based on [template](https://blog.jetbrains.com/rust/2024/11/29/advent-of-code-in-rust-for-the-rest-of-us/) shared by JetBrains to get me started faster.
